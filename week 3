🔹 1. MIT License (Permissive, Minimal)

✅ Freedom: You can use, modify, and redistribute the code — even in closed-source/proprietary software.

⚖️ Obligation: Must include the copyright notice and license text.

🔓 Effect: Very business-friendly; almost no restrictions.

🔹 2. GNU GPL (Copyleft, Strict)

✅ Freedom: You can use, modify, and redistribute, but…

⚖️ Obligation: Any derivative or combined work must also be released under GPL (the “copyleft” rule).

🔒 Effect: Ensures software stays open-source forever. Not compatible with proprietary use.

Example: If you link GPL code into your app, your whole app may have to be GPL.

🔹 3. Apache License 2.0 (Permissive + Patent Protection)

✅ Freedom: Like MIT, you can use in open-source or proprietary projects.

⚖️ Obligation: Must preserve license & notices, state changes, and include NOTICE file.

🛡️ Unique Feature: Provides an explicit patent license, protecting users from patent claims.

🔓 Effect: Popular in enterprise projects (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka) because it balances openness with business safety.
