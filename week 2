Notice is where the business or website explains what data they collect and what they 
do with it
consent is where you as an individual actively agree to the company's use of your data.
Purpose limitation is the protection of personal data to be collected for a specific reason and used for a specific reason rather than letting a company use your data for whatever they want without notification.
Data minimization is when a company takes the least amount of data needed for them to do the job needed, not to take more than they need. 

To protect my stakeholders, I would ensure that data would be used ethically in the way I would protect a business and not have any unethical use of personal data of anyone that I would be attached to.
